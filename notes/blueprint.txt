So, we have a google form for students and an approval method for teachers/secretary

Students will have the following options: 
    - which staff member they want to speak to
    - ASK: reason for appointment 
        - the secretary can either approve this or not, but if not approved an email with reasoning 
          will be sent back to the student.  
    - time they need

    
-use BABEL to write js and transpile it into google apps script (cos it literally is missing so many features)
-push js to apps script project with CLASP 

use Apps Script API to allow clasp tool to interact with project  code

- store student data in the following: 
  google sheet requestForm
   
HOLY CRAP, CLASP IS SO COOL, IVE NEVER USED IT BUT ITS SO COOL HOW IT WORKS WOAHHHH


typescript, autocomplter

commands: 

clasp push
clasp pull
clasp push -w (watch) going to run and then push everytime I save (ITS REALLY COOL)

okay, in terms of every ss having things a full week ahead, were going to make them somehow - my brain isnt working properly (sensory overloading rn)
where, u may ask, well, i will present an answer: were going to be making them not EVERY call, thats stupid, but we'll put it at the top and hopefully that works haha (PLEASE)

omg! if you appendRow([]) with sqaure brackets like that, youll use the reference instead of the real value

okay, so we're going to have to first check what teacher they selected, then we'll check what period they want
now the issue will be making new stupid google sheets. we have to make sure they're named monday, tuesday, wednesday, and so on
then, starting with the day after the day they're booking their appointments (meaning you have to book a day in advance) holy crap but they have to be able to book on weekends then? 
unless i can prevent the program from checking certain dates and times (this is so annoying)
okay we won't worry about that until later 

so, check teacher and period for now. 

hello git are u there

just have a few things left to do:
  - gotta figure out how to make a new day 
  - gotta do random numbers (god i will cry)
  - gotta do (i frogot what i was going to type)

  wait, this is amazing, stuff works

  apperently, when app scipt returns a day  of the week with date() func, it numbers the day of the week with 0 for sunday, 1 for monday, and so on
